          My name is Zakaria and I'm a Fullstack Web Developer based in Halle
          (Saale). When I moved to Germany in 2019, I explored various sectors,
          starting as a milker and eventually transitioning to warehouse work.
          During this time, I realized that I wanted to grow professionally and
          challenge myself more, leading me to discover my true calling: web
          development. In September 2023, I took a significant step towards my
          dream by enrolling in a training program at the DCI to become a
          full-stack web developer. I successfully completed the program in
          October 2024. Over the course of 12 months, I gained extensive
          knowledge in both frontend and backend development, specializing in
          the MERN stack. Throughout my training, I applied my skills to
          numerous projects - both small and a larger final project -
          demonstrating my technical abilities as well as my teamwork and
          project management skills. When Iâ€™m not coding, I love to take long
          walks or hit the gym. These activities help me clear my mind and
          recharge after spending time in front of a screen. I believe that
          staying active is key to maintaining creativity and focus in my work.
          I am now eager to join an innovative company that prioritizes customer
          satisfaction and is committed to delivering modern web solutions and
          digital products.
